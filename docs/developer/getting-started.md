# Getting started

You can use the information in your Federated Directory in your own applications

We made it as easy as possible to get started with our (SCIM compliant) APIs and integrate it into your application.

## Sign Up

You’ll need a Federated Directory to get started. If you don’t have one already, sign up for free to [create one](/getting-started#f1). You will get 20 users and all the features for free.

## Setup your environment

1. [Create an Access token](/developer/obtaining-a-token) within your company. During this introduction we will use an access token of a directory key. A directory key only has administrative rights on the directory it was created in.

2. [Install the Postman app](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)

3. Launch Postman and click the Import button. Select Import From Link, and paste this link into the textbox:

   - `https://help.federated.directory/assets/files/api.federated.directory.postman_environment.json` <br><br>
     <img style="width: 450px" src="/images/developer-gettingstarted-pmenvironment1.jpg" alt="Import the Federated Directory Getting Started Environment"/>

4. Once it’s imported, make sure the _api.federated.directory_ environment is selected.

5. Click the eye icon next to `api.federated.directory` and select **Edit** to replace the following values:

<br>

| Value       | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| accessToken | Enter the access token you created earlier. This will be used in all API calls within the Postman demo collection.                                                    |
| directoryId | The unique ID of the directory your users will be created in. You can find it under the 'settings' tab on the same directory you created the directory key in step 1. |

Click Update to save your changes.

## Import our Postman demo collection

Launch Postman and click the Import button. Select Import From Link, and paste this link into the textbox:

- `https://api.postman.com/collections/3391846-b6f8dc30-4a1e-4f29-b6ab-d20d9e216c75?access_key=PMAT-01GMK0V1P25KNWPQC2J87AH4NZ`

## Send some requests

Within the Postman demo collection you will find example API calls for the scenario's below. Since we are using a directory key, all queries are limited to the directory the key was created in.

Perform the below queries in the correct order. IDs of the created users are used in the subsequent search, update and delete calls.

**1. Create a new user**

The body already contains a detailed JSON of an example user. You can of course always adjust this or create your own.  
In the response you will find the users ID that you just created. This ID is stored as an environment variable in the Postman 'tests' of this request. We will use this in the next request to retrieve, update and delete this user.

**2. Bulk create new users**

Create multiple users simultaneously with a bulk request.  
The body already contains a detailed JSON of a valid bulk request to create 4 users. All these users will be created in the "Bulk" department in the "Getting Started" division. The IDs of the returned users are stored as environment variables.

**3. Search for users**

Retrieve all the users in the "Bulk" department in the "Getting Started" division. Will only return the requested attributes. Also check out the [Users API](/developer/users-api) documentation for more advanced query options.

**4. Retrieve the profile data from user**

Get the profile data from the user created in step 1. It will only return the requested attributes. Requires a correct user ID in the environment settings.

**5a. Update a user (patch)**

A `patch` call will only change the mentioned attributes in the patch call. All other attributes will stay untouched. The response contains the complete user.

**5b. Update a user (put)**

A `put` call should contain all attributes of a user. Attributes not included in the body will be removed or reset. The response contains the complete user.

**6. Delete a user**

Delete the user created in step 1. No body in the response.

**7. Bulk delete all created users**

Remove all the users created in step 2.

These demo API calls should give you a good understanding of some basic functions of our APIs.
More details can be found within our [Users API](/developer/users-api) documentation and our [Interactive API Reference](/developer/api-reference).
