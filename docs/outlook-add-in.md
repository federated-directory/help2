# Microsoft Outlook add-in


The contact data within a Federated Directory of a company is precious. The data gets even more powerful when it is accessible at the right moment; within the applications and services this company is already using. It is, therefore logical to deliver an add-in to one of the world's most commonly used e-mail clients: Microsoft Outlook.

## Installation

Our add-in is called "Federated Directory - Contacts" and is available on the [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200001432?tab=Overview).
To install the add-in on a single account, you can follow the [Microsoft Guide](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-an-office-add-in-for-outlook-1ee261f9-49bf-4ba6-b3e2-2ba7bcab64c8).
If you would like to deploy our add-in in your organization, you should follow Microsoft's recommendations - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide

## Using the add-in in Outlook

After the add-in is installed, you can open your Outlook client - desktop or on the web. If Outlook was already opened, close it entirely and reopen it again.

As soon as you start composing a [new message](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-email-message-147208af-ca8e-4cdf-b71f-77ba81a54069) you will see a Federated Directory icon in the top bar. If it’s not visible, click on a “Message” tab inside your new message window.
