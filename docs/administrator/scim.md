Federated Directory supports the management of your users with the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard.

With SCIM provisioning you can manage your users more efficiently:

- Create a new user
- Update users' profile information
- Deactivate a user
- Delete a user

Any identity management system, that supports SCIM 2.0, can be used to integrate with our APIs. You could even build your own integration from scratch. It's your data and it's up to you how you manage it.

You can find a detailed description of our APIs and data model in the [developer section](../developer/getting-started).
