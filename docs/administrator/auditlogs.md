# Audit logs

Every change made within your Federated Directory environment is recorded and can be reviewed. We store this information in two different audit logs:

- General audit log
- Directory audit log

## General audit log

You can find this audit log directly in the main menu, but only if you have an administrator role. This audit log contains every change to the company information, profile, API key or groups.

## Directory audit log

Directory log contains information about all the changes made within that directory. For example: users that are created, modified or deleted and changes made to the configuration of the directory itself.

Such a log can be found within the directory edit view. To open it, first click on 'Directories' menu item and then on one of the available directories. In provided view, you will find tab **LOGS**, next to the **USERS**, **CONFIG** and **KEYS**.
