IDs of the created users are used in the subsequent search, update and delete calls.</p><p><strong>1. Create a new user</strong></p><p>The body already contains a detailed JSON of an example user. You can of course always adjust this or create your own.<br> In the response you will find the users ID that you just created. This ID is stored as an environment variable in the Postman &#39;tests&#39; of this request. We will use this in the next request to retrieve, update and delete this user.</p><p><strong>2. Bulk create new users</strong></p><p>Create multiple users simultaneously with a bulk request.<br> The body already contains a detailed JSON of a valid bulk request to create 4 users. All these users will be created in the &quot;Bulk&quot; department in the &quot;Getting Started&quot; division. The IDs of the returned users are stored as environment variables.</p><p><strong>3. Search for users</strong></p><p>Retrieve all the users in the &quot;Bulk&quot; department in the &quot;Getting Started&quot; division. Will only return the requested attributes. Also check out the <a href="/developer/users-api">Users API</a> documentation for more advanced query options.</p><p><strong>4. Retrieve the profile data from user</strong></p><p>Get the profile data from the user created in step 1. It will only return the requested attributes. Requires a correct user ID in the environment settings.</p><p><strong>5a. Update a user (patch)</strong></p><p>A <code>patch</code> call will only change the mentioned attributes in the patch call. All other attributes will stay untouched. The response contains the complete user.</p><p><strong>5b. Update a user (put)</strong></p><p>A <code>put</code> call should contain all attributes of a user. Attributes not included in the body will be removed or reset. The response contains the complete user.</p><p><strong>6. Delete a user</strong></p><p>Delete the user created in step 1. No body in the response.</p><p><strong>7. Bulk delete all created users</strong></p><p>Remove all the users created in step 2.</p><br><p>These demo API calls should give you a good understanding of some basic functions of our APIs.
