A group can contain users from multiple companies and/or directories.</p><p>Your company contains one group after sign up: the &quot;all users&quot; group. By default, this group will contain all the users within your company. This makes sure all the users in your company are able to find each other.

Invited users will receive an email that they can accept.</p><p>This is the only way you can add a user from another company to your group. Once that user has accepted your invite, you can make it a &#39;group owner&#39; as well. At that point it can add more users from its company.</p><h4 id="automatically" tabindex="-1"><strong>Automatically</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#automatically" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Automatically**&quot;">​</a></h4><p>When you are a group owner and an admin within your company you can add users to a group automatically with a &#39;smart filter&#39;. This &#39;smart filter&#39; adds all the users to this group that meets this specific filter. For example users that are:</p><ul><li>Part of a division or department</li><li>Have been synced from a specific directory</li></ul><p><a href="./groups">GO TO GROUPS</a></p><h3 id="search-across-companies" tabindex="-1">Search across companies <a class="header-anchor" href="#search-across-companies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Search across companies&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You and your colleagues can now <a href="./login">login</a> and <a href="./search">search</a> through all the directories at the same time.
