Press the "update logo" button and your new company logo will be uploaded, optimized, and shown in places like the login page and within the navigation bar.

## Verified domains

By adding and verifying your company's domains, you can restrict users within your organization from creating their own Federated Directory. Once you verify a domain, users with email addresses using that domain will not be able to create their own directory.

To validate a domain follow these steps

1. Log in to your domain registrar's website and access your DNS settings.
2. Create a new TXT record with the following information:
   - Name: Enter "@" or leave it blank.
   - Value: Enter the CompanyID provided to you.
3. Save the changes to your DNS settings.
4. Wait for the DNS changes to propagate, which can take up to 24-48 hours.
5. Enter the domain name below and click on the "Verify" button.

Please note that the exact steps to create a TXT record may vary depending on your domain registrar.

## Session time

Number of minutes a user within your company stays logged onto the Federated Directory portal.

| Input   | Description                                                                     |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| minutes | Default is 480 minutes (8 hours). Min 1 minute and max 525600 minutes (1 year). |

## Custom user attributes

If your company wants to store some specific data on your users that is not covered by the default attributes available on a user, you should use 'custom user attributes'.

There are 3 custom attributes available which you can give any name you would like. This name, is the name the users in your company will see in their user interface.

<img style="width: 500px" src="../../assets/images/company-custom_attributes.png " alt="Name your custom attributes"/>

Custom attributes can contain 150 characters (max) and users are able to use them in a filter, just like like the 'division' or 'department' attributes.

<img style="width: 500px" src="../../assets/images/company-custom_attributes2.png " alt="Filter on custom attributes"/>

When you name a custom attribute, it will appear as a new attribute on your users as part of the 'enterprise' related attributes.

2. Add Payment Information. Securely enter your credit card details.
   - Usually you will be asked to validate your credit card in this process.
3. Choose the Number of Licenses.
   - Before confirming your subscription, the system will calculate the monthly costs based on the number of users you've selected. You will see these costs displayed for your review.
