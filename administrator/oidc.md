# Integrate with OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect-based single sign-on (SSO) gives your users access to Federated Directory through an identity provider (IDP) of your choice.

## Authentication

If your identity provider of choice does not have a ready made integration with us, you have the option to use a custom OpenID Connect connection.
Federated Directory uses the OpenID Connect 'Authorization Code Flow'.

Enabling this, is as easy as selecting `OpenID Connect` from the authentication settings on a directory.

During the authentication process we map the users username (`preferred_username`) with the `userName` of this user within our directory. We only allow access to those users we already know. First we will look for the `preferred_username` in the `id_token`. Incase it is not present in the `id_token`, we will look for the `preferred_username` in the `userinfo` which we will retrieve at your IDP.

Make sure the users username is unique.

|           | OpenID Connect id_token or userinfo | Federated Directory |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Attribute |         preferred_username          |     userName ️️     |

| Login_hint    | Optionally included in the request and can used by your IDP to simplify the authentication flow. Only when we already received a userName through another authentication method. |

Your IDP must ensure a user is both authenticated and authorized before sending an authorization code. If a user isn't authorized, assertions should not be sent. We recommend your IDP redirect a user to an HTTP 403 page or something similar.
