This ID is stored as an environment variable in the Postman ‘tests’ of this request. We will use this in the next request to retrieve, update and delete this user. 2. Bulk create new users . Create multiple users simultaneously with a bulk request. The body already contains a detailed JSON of a valid bulk request to create 4 users. All these users will be created in the “Bulk” department in the “Getting Started” division. The IDs of the returned users are stored as environment variables. 3. Search for users . Retrieve all the users in the “Bulk” department in the “Getting Started” division. Will only return the requested attributes. Also check out the Users API documentation for more advanced query options. 4. Retrieve the profile data from user . Get the profile data from the user created in step 1. It will only return the requested attributes. Requires a correct user ID in the environment settings. 5a. Update a user (patch) . A patch call will only change the mentioned attributes in the patch call. All other attributes will stay untouched. The response contains the complete user. 5b. Update a user (put) . A put call should contain all attributes of a user. Attributes not included in the body will be removed or reset. The response contains the complete user. 6. Delete a user . Delete the user created in step 1. No body in the response. 7. Bulk delete all created users . Remove all the users created in step 2. These demo API calls should give you a good understanding of some basic functions of our APIs. More details can be found within our Users API documentation. ",

Invite them . After you create a group you can invite other to that group by inviting them. Invited users will receive an email that they can accept. This is the only way you can add a user from another company to your group. Once that user has accepted your invite, you can make it a ‘group owner’ as well. At that point it can add more users from its company. Automatically . When you are a group owner and an admin within your company you can add users to a group automatically with a ‘smart filter’. This ‘smart filter’ adds all the users to this group that meets this specific filter. For example users that are: . | Part of a division or department | Have been synced from a specific directory | . GO TO GROUPS . Search across companies . You and your colleagues can now login and search through all the directories at the same time.

The body of a patch call includes an Operations array. Every object in this array contains a specific operation (add, remove, replace) on one or more attributes of this user. There are two types of Operation objects: . 1. With a path key One user attribute per operation can be changed. The path indicates the user attribute that needs to be changed. In case of an ‘add’ or ‘replace’ operation, will the new value be present in the ‘value’ key. 2. Without a path key Every operation can change multiple user attributes. Every operation can basically contain part . Body with a path key . This operation consists out of the following attributes. | Key | Value | . | op | ‘add’, ‘replace’ or ‘remove’ | . | path | The user attribute. | . | value | The new value of the attribute. | . Every operation modifies one attribute. Since every attribute should be defined explicitly (even in a multi valued attribute like emails), an ‘add’ operation is the same as a ‘replace’ operation. An attribute is defined in the path and MAY be uniquely identified by prefixing the attribute name with its schema URN separated by a colon (“:”) character; e.g., the core User resource attribute ‘userName’ is identified as “urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:userName” or just as “userName”. Complex attributes’ sub-attributes are referenced via nested dot (‘.’) notation, i.e., {urn}:{Attribute name}.{Sub-Attribute name}. For example, the fully qualified path for a User’s givenName is “urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:name.givenName” (or just ‘name.givenName’). All facets (URN, attribute, and sub-attribute name) of the fully encoded attribute name are case insensitive. Multi value attributes like ‘emails’,’phoneNumbers’ &amp; ‘addresses’ include the ‘type’ in the ‘path’: . | emails[type eq \"work\"].value | phoneNumbers[type eq \"home\"].value | addresses[type eq \"work\"].streetAddress | photos[type eq \"thumbnail\"].value | . The ‘manager’ and ‘roles’ attributes are not multi valued but rather complex. Their ‘path’ is actually pretty easy: . | manager | roles | . The value is defined as a string or as an array with one object. Usually, this object contains one value attribute, except for the ‘manager’. In that case it could also contain a displayName. If they are both defined, the value of the manager | takes precedence. Body without a path key . This operation consists out of the following attributes. | Attribute | Value | . | op | ‘add’ or ‘replace’ | . | value | The new value of the attribute. Only in case of an ‘add’ or a ‘replace’ | . Every operation modifies one or more attribute. Since every attribute should be defined explicitly (even in a multi valued attribute like emails), an ‘add’ operation is the same as a ‘replace’ operation. The attributes in the value object have the exact same format as the user attributes in a POST or PUT call. But in this case it can contain parts of user and only the attributes mentioned in this object will be replaced on the user. Example Request .
