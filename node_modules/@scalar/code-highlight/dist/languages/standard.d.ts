 * the languages they need.
 *
 * 1. Standard Languages: These are the most popular languages that cover the
 *    majority of use cases.
 * 2. Medium Languages: These languages are not as popular as the ones in
 *    `standardLanguages`, but still have a decent amount of users.
 * 3. Specialized Languages: These languages are more specialized and have a
 *    smaller user base.
 *
 * Each category is represented as a separate object, making it easy to import
 * only the languages you need.
