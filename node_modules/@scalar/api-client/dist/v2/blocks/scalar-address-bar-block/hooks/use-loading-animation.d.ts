/**
 * Manages the loading animation for the address bar.
 *
 * The animation has two phases:
 * 1. While requesting: Animates asymptotically toward 85% to indicate ongoing work
 * 2. After request completes: Animates linearly to 100% over 400ms for smooth completion
 *
 * This creates a natural feel where the bar does not instantly jump to 100%,
 * making the loading experience more predictable and less jarring.
 *
 * @returns An object with methods to control the loading animation and the current percentage
