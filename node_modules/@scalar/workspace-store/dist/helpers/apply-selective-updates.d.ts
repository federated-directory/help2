/**
 * Applies updates from an updated document to an original document, while excluding changes to certain metadata keys.
 *
 * This function computes the differences between the original and updated documents,
 * filters out any diffs that affect excluded keys (such as navigation, external references, or status fields),
 * and applies only the allowed changes to the original document in place.
 *
 * Note: The originalDocument is mutated directly.
 *
 * @param originalDocument - The document to be updated (mutated in place)
 * @param updatedDocument - The document containing the desired changes
 * @returns A tuple: [the updated original document, array of excluded diffs that were not applied]
