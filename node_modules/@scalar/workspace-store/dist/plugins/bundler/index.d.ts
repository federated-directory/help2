 * A lifecycle plugin that adds a `$status` property to nodes during resolution.

/**
 * Lifecycle plugin to resolve and embed external content referenced by an 'externalValue' property in a node.
 *
 * When a node contains an 'externalValue' property (as a string), this plugin will:
 *   - Fetch the external resource (such as a URL or file) using the fetchUrls plugin.
 *   - If the fetch is successful, assign the fetched data to the node's 'value' property.
 *
 * This is useful for inlining external content (like examples or schemas) into the OpenAPI document during bundling.
 *
 * @param node - The node being processed, which may contain an 'externalValue' property.

/**
 * Lifecycle plugin to resolve $ref on any object, including non-standard locations like the info object.
 *
 * This plugin will:
 *   - Detect if a node contains a $ref property (as a string).
 *   - If the node is under the 'info' path, attempt to resolve the reference using fetchUrls.
 *   - Replace the node's properties with the resolved data if successful.
 *
 * Note: This currently only supports refs on the 'info' object and does not handle primitive types.

/**
 * Lifecycle plugin to restore original $ref values after processing.
 *
 * This plugin is intended to be used as a "lifecycle" plugin in the bundling process.
 * It operates in the `onAfterNodeProcess` hook, and its main purpose is to restore
 * the original $ref values for external references that may have been replaced or
 * rewritten during the bundling process.
 *
 * How it works:
 * - For each node processed, if the node contains a $ref property (as a string),
 *   and the root document contains an "x-ext-urls" mapping object,
 *   the plugin will attempt to restore the original $ref value.
 * - The "x-ext-urls" object is expected to be a mapping from the rewritten $ref
 *   (e.g., a hashed or compressed reference) back to the original external URL or path.
 * - If a mapping exists for the current $ref, the plugin replaces the $ref value
 *   with the original value from the mapping. If no mapping exists (e.g., for local refs),
 *   the $ref value is left unchanged.
 *
 * This is useful for scenarios where you want to present or export the bundled document
 * with the original external $ref values, rather than the internal or rewritten ones.
 *
 * @returns {LifecyclePlugin} The plugin object for use in the bundler.

/**
 * Lifecycle plugin to normalize the `scheme` property in securitySchemes to lowercase.
 *
 * Our typebox schemas require the `scheme` property to be a lowercase string.
 * This plugin ensures that any `scheme` field under `components.securitySchemes` is normalized to lowercase, fixing
 * potential user input errors such as "Bearer" or "BASIC".
 *
 * Example:
 * ```yaml
 * Before normalization:
 *   components:
 *     securitySchemes:
 *       bearerAuth:
 *         type: http
 *         scheme: Bearer
 * ```
 * After normalization:
 * ```yaml
 *   components:
 *     securitySchemes:
 *       bearerAuth:
 *         type: http
 *         scheme: bearer
 * ```
